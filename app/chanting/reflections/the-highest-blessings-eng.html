      [00:00.0] ### The Highest Blessings

      [00:00.1] ##### <i>from Amarvati Buddhist Monastery</i>
      <hr />
      [00:00.6] [ Thus have I heard that the Blessed One ]

      [00:06.1] Was staying at S^āv`atthī,
      [00:11.1] _Residing_ at the Jeta’s Grove

      [00:14.50] In Anāthap^iṇḍik`a’s Park.
      [00:18.1] _Then_ in the dark of the night, a r^adi`ant d`eva

      [00:23.7] Illuminated _all_ J^et`a’s Grove.
      [00:27.6] She bowed down low before the Bl`essed One

      [00:32.4] Then standing to one s^ide sh`e said:
      [00:35.9] ‘Devas are concerned for h^appiness

      [00:40.0] And ever l^ong f`or peace.
      [00:43.1] The same is true for h^umankind.

      [00:47.0] What _then_ are the h^ighest bl`essings?’
      [00:50.5] ‘`Av`oiding those of fo`olish ways,

      [00:54.4] `Ass`ociating w^ith th`e wise,

      [00:57.0] And h`onouring those w^orthy of h`onour.

      [01:01.5] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [01:05.1] ‘L`iving in places of suitable kinds,

      [01:09.0] With the fru`its of past go`od deeds

      [01:12.5] `And gu`ided by the r^ightf`ul way.

      [01:15.6] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [01:19.0] ‘Acc`omplished in l`earn`ing `and cr`aftsman’s skills,

      [01:23.1] With d`iscipline, high`ly trained,

      [01:26.4] And _speech_ that is true and pl^easant t`o hear.

      _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.
