      [00:00.1] ##### <i>from Amarvati Buddhist Monastery</i>
      <hr />
      [00:00.6] [ Thus have I heard that the Blessed One ]

      [00:06.1] Was staying at S^āv`atthī,
      [00:10.9] _Residing_ at the Jeta’s Grove

      [00:14.50] In Anāthap^iṇḍik`a’s Park.
      [00:18.1] _Then_ in the dark of the night, a r^adi`ant d`eva

      [00:23.6] Illuminated _all_ J^et`a’s Grove.
      [00:27.4] She bowed down low before the Bl`essed One

      [00:32.3] Then standing to one s^ide sh`e said:
      [00:35.9] ‘Devas are concerned for h^appiness

      [00:39.9] And ever l^ong f`or peace.
      [00:43.1] The same is true for h^umankind.

      [00:47.0] What _then_ are the h^ighest bl`essings?’
      [00:50.5] ‘`Av`oiding those of fo`olish ways,

      [00:54.4] `Ass`ociating w^ith th`e wise,

      [00:57.0] And h`onouring those w^orthy of h`onour.

      [01:01.5] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [01:04.9] ‘L`iving in places of suitable kinds,

      [01:08.8] With the fru`its of past go`od deeds

      [01:12.3] `And gu`ided by the r^ightf`ul way.

      [01:15.4] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [01:18.8] ‘Acc`omplished in l`earn`ing `and cr`aftsman’s skills,

      [01:22.9] With d`iscipline, high`ly trained,

      [01:26.2] And _speech_ that is true and pl^easant t`o hear.

      [01:30.9] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [01:34.0] ‘Prov`iding for mother and father’s support

      [01:38.6] And ch^erishing family,

      [01:41.1] And ways of work that h^arm n`o being,

      [01:44.9] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [01:48.6] Giving with Dh`amma in the heart

      [01:51.6] Offering help to r^elat`ives and kin,

      [01:55.4] And acting in ways that l^eave n`o blame.

      [01:59.3] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [02:02.5] ‘Steadfast in r`estraint, and shunning ^evil ways,

      [02:07.3] Av`oiding int^oxicants that d`ull the mind,

      [02:11.2] And heedf`ulness in all things th^at arise.

      [02:15.6] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [02:19.0] ‘Resp`ectfulness and of humble ways,

      [02:22.5] Contentment and gr^atitude,

      [02:25.4] And hearing the Dh`amma fr^equent`ly taught.

      [02:29.5] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [02:32.8] ‘Patience and wil`lingness to accept one’s faults,

      [02:36.8] Seeing venerated s^eekers of th`e truth,

      [02:40.9] And sharing `often the w^ords of Dh`amma.

      [02:44.8] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [02:48.3] ‘The h`oly life, lived with ardent effort,

      [02:52.1] Seeing for ones^elf the Nobl`e Truths

      [02:56.0] And the realization of Nibb`āna.

      [02:59.6] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [03:02.8] ‘Although involved in worldly ways,

      [03:06.3] Unsh`aken the m^ind `remains

      [03:09.6] And beyond all s`orrow, sp^otless, s`ecure.

      [03:13.8] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.

      [03:16.8] ‘Th`ey who _live_ by f`ollowing this path

      [03:20.6] Know v`ictory wh^erever th`ey go,

      [03:24.0] And every _place_ for them `is safe.

      [03:27.6] _These_ are the h^ighest bl`essings.’
