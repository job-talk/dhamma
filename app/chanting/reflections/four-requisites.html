      [00:02.0] [ Ha`nda mayaṃ taṅkhaṇika-paccavekkhaṇa-pāṭhaṃ bhaṇāmase ]
      [00:06.0]   I am subject to aging. Aging is unavoidable.

      [00:11.0] Byādh^i-dhammomh`i byādhiṃ `an`atīto
      [00:16.10]   I am subject to illness. Illness is unavoidable.

      [00:21.30] M`araṇa-dhammomh`i m`araṇaṃ `an`atīto
      [00:26.0]    I am subject to death. Death is unavoidable.

      [00:31.0] S`abbehi me p`iyehi m`anāpeh`i nānābhāvo v`inābhāvo
      [00:38.50]  I will grow different, separate from all that is dear & appealing to me.

      [00:45.20] Kammass`akomhi kamm^adāyādo, kamm`ayoni kamm`abandhu kamma-p`aṭis^araṇo
      [00:55.0]  I am the owner of my actions, heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and live dependent on my actions.

      [01:09.0] Yaṃ kammaṃ k`arissāmi kalyāṇaṃ vā pāp`akaṃ vā, tass`a dāyādo bh`avissāmi.
      [01:19.0]   Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir.

      [01:25.45] Evaṃ amheh`i `abhiṇhaṃ pacc`avekkh^itabbaṃ
      [01:31.0]   We should often reflect on this.
